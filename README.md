# city-explorer-uber
A web application to "explore a particular city, or an arbitrary region of a city, with regard to trip volume, common pickups or dropoffs, common routes, high or low speeds, etc."

# Client

Anyone at the ATC who wishes to explore a particular city, or an arbitrary region of a city, with regard to trip volume, common pickups or dropoffs, common routes, high or low speeds, or other factors you can think of. The client should be able to select an arbitrary region within a given city and see one or more analyses. Assume that your clients are not coders, so design and build with that in mind.
